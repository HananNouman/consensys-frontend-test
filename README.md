# Frontend Assignment Test

The goal of this technical test is to evaluate ability in core competence areas relevant
to our organization.

These include:

- Ability to use modern Javascript frameworks to interact with APIs.
- Competence with creation and implementation of basic designs.
- Aptitude with HTML and CSS to create clean, readable and performant code.

# Overview

The aim of the test is to develop a mini-application for managing TODO tasks.

Using your application we must be able to create, modify and delete a task.

A really simple server has been implemented with Express. It offers the minimum of expected functionalities (get the list of tasks, update a task, delete a task, save a task).

However this server is not perfect. It could be improved and tested as well.

So your mission is to develop the front-end from scratch using a front-end framework.

We are also expecting from you a usable, responsive UI (Mobile Responsive Layout).
